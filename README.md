# A Sudoku Program to play the game
## Entirely implemented on C++

Made by two college students fooling around for their OOPs project. 



_**Sudoku is a number based game which is played by a single player provided the board
for the game is already set for him.**_ (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

The layout of the board is similar to the one given below.

The board above has 9 rows and 9 columns that is, 81 cells.

In the board each cell is filled with a number from 1 to 9 and when the whole board is filled with numbers the game is completed and the user wins!

Though there are certain restrictions when filling the numbers:
1. Each row will have numbers 1 to 9 and no two cells in the row can have same numbers.
2. Each column will have numbers 1 to 9 and no two cells in the column can have same numbers.
3. Also, there are smaller squares of 3 rows and 3 column within which there need to be numbers from 1 to 9 and no two cells within the square can have same numbers.

As long as these 3 conditions are fulfilled the numbers will be entered and you would be closer to winning the game each time.

Happy solving everyone!
